## 🌟 Brand Guide: Project "Neopetmon"

### 1. Core Philosophy & Vibe

This brand is built on a foundation of **whimsical, charmingly chaotic, and endlessly playful** energy. It is a direct callback to the "early 2000s internet" aesthetic, prioritizing fun and discovery over minimalist design.

* **Vibe:** Cozy, familiar, slightly quirky, and full of personality.
* **Tone:** Overwhelmingly friendly, encouraging, and upbeat. Use simple language and positive exclamations ("Wow!", "You did it!").
* **Feel:** The game should feel like a "place" to hang out, not a high-stress challenge.

### 2. 🎨 Color Palette

This is a bright, saturated, and cheerful palette. Avoid muted tones, desaturation, or dark, moody themes.

| Role | Color Name | HEX Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | **Neopian Blue** | **`#3E77E4`** | Main UI (nav bars, window frames), buttons, logos. |
| **Primary** | **Golden Yellow** | **`#FFCC00`** | Currency (Neopoints), stars, highlights, special items. |
| **Primary** | **Grassy Green** | **`#5FBB4E`** | Nature backgrounds, "success" messages, positive UI. |
| Secondary | Bright Red | `#E63939` | "Close" buttons, errors, health bars, warnings. |
| Secondary | Faerieland Purple | `#964ED4` | Magic, special effects, secondary UI theme. |
| Secondary | Cheery Orange | `#FF9900` | Secondary buttons, alerts, warm accents. |
| **Utility** | **Dark Blue** | **`#003366`** | **Critical for outlines.** Also used for primary text. |
| **Utility** | **Simple Black** | **`#000000`** | A secondary choice for body text and details. |
| **Utility** | **Pure White** | **`#FFFFFF`** | The default background for all content windows. |
| **Utility** | **Sky Blue** | **`#CDE8F6`** | For simple background sky gradients (fades to white). |

### 3. ⌨️ Typography

Typography must be "bubbly" for titles and "highly readable" for everything else.

#### A. Logo & Headlines

* **Font:** Use a bold, rounded, cartoonish font.
    * **Recommendations:** **Fredoka One** (Google Font) or **Bangers** (Google Font).
* **Style:** This is critical. All titles **must** have:
    1.  A thick, hard outline (2-4px) using **Dark Blue (`#003366`)**.
    2.  A simple, hard drop shadow, offset to the bottom-right.

#### B. UI & Body Text

* **Font:** Use a clean, rounded, web-safe sans-serif. The authentic choice is best.
    * **Recommendation:** **Verdana**. It's the classic. Use **Tahoma** as a fallback.
* **Style:**
    * **Size:** 12-14pt for standard text.
    * **Color:** Use **Simple Black (`#000000`)** or **Dark Blue (`#003366`)** for maximum readability on white backgrounds.
    * **Emphasis:** Make generous use of `**bolding**` to add personality to descriptions.

### 4. ✨ UI & Component Styling (For Phaser)

This defines the "feel" of the game's interface.

#### A. Buttons

* **Shape:** Chunky, highly rounded rectangles. They must look "pressable."
* **Style:** Emulate the "aqua" or "gel" button effect.
    1.  **Base:** Use a primary color like **Neopian Blue (`#3E77E4`)**.
    2.  **Highlight:** Add a semi-transparent white oval or "gloss" effect at the top.
    3.  **Gradient:** Apply a simple vertical gradient (e.g., slightly lighter blue to the main blue).
    4.  **Border:** A thin, dark border is acceptable.
* **Hover State:** Simple and direct. The button should "brighten" or "glow."

#### B. Windows & Modals

* **Shape:** Rounded rectangles.
* **Frame:** All UI windows (inventory, dialogue, stats) **must** have a thick, visible "frame" border.
    * **Border Color:** Use **Neopian Blue (`#3E77E4`)**.
    * **Border Width:** 2px or 3px.
* **Background:** Always **Pure White (`#FFFFFF`)**.
* **Title Bar:** The top of the window should have a "title bar" in the frame color, with the window's title in white or yellow text.

#### C. HUD & Layout

* **Structure:** The screen should be divided into clear, bordered "zones."
* **Example Layout:**
    * **Top Bar (full-width):** Holds main navigation, settings, and currency (using the **Golden Yellow** icon).
    * **Side Bar (left or right):** A dedicated, framed panel showing the player's "Pet" stats, status, and equipment.
    * **Main Area:** The central part where the game action happens.

### 5. 🖼️ Iconography & Graphics

* **Style:** Simple, 2D, and illustrative. Think of them as small "stickers."
* **Outlines:** All key game items and icons should have a simple 1px black outline to "pop" from the background, just like the old Neopet items.
* **Motifs:** Use simple, repeating motifs: stars, sparkles, fluffy clouds, paw prints, and swirls.

### Summary: The Golden Rule

> **When in doubt, ask: "Is this modern, slick, and minimalist?"**
>
> If the answer is yes, **do the opposite.** Strive for **charming, bubbly, and bold.**
