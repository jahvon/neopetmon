# Neopetmon

Explore the colorful world of Neopia with your very own Neopet companion! Choose from 55 different species, care for your pet, and befriend wild Neopets you encounter on your journey.

## What You Can Do

**Choose Your Companion**
Start your adventure by selecting one of 55 unique Neopet species. Give your pet a name and watch them come to life in a vibrant summer world.

**Explore & Encounter**
Roam freely through Neopia using arrow keys or WASD. Wild Neopets wander the landscape - each with their own personality and mood. Some are friendly, others cautious, and a few might be feeling grumpy!

**Build Your Collection**
When you encounter wild Neopets, you have two paths:
- **Battle** them in turn-based combat to gain experience and rewards
- **Befriend** them by offering treats, playing, and talking - build trust to add them to your Neopian Gallery

**Care for Your Pet**
Your Neopet depends on you! Keep them happy, well-fed, and rested. Press 'C' to access the care menu where you can:
- Feed your pet to restore hunger
- Let them rest to regain energy
- Use potions to heal after tough battles
- Check their happiness and overall wellbeing

**Complete Your Gallery**
Every Neopet you befriend gets recorded in your Neopian Gallery. Track your collection, see which species you've encountered, and work toward befriending all 55 species!

**Grow Stronger**
Win battles to level up your pet, increasing their HP, attack, and defense. The stronger you become, the more challenging encounters you can take on.

## How to Play

**Getting Started**
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

**Basic Controls**
- **Arrow Keys / WASD** - Move around the world
- **C** - Open the care menu
- **G** - Open your Neopian Gallery
- **Mouse** - Click buttons and interact with menus

**During Encounters**
When you bump into a wild Neopet, you'll see their mood and can choose:
- **Battle** - Fight them in turn-based combat (ATTACK, POTION, or RUN)
- **Befriend** - Try to earn their trust by offering treats, playing, or talking
- **Run** - Leave the encounter

**Tips for Success**
- Keep your pet's stats high - hungry, tired, or unhappy pets won't battle as well
